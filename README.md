K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity of the input data to its neighboring data points.

Here's how the KNN algorithm works:

Training Phase: During the training phase, the algorithm stores the feature vectors and their corresponding class labels (in the case of classification) or target values (in the case of regression) of the training dataset.

Choosing K: The parameter K represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider for making predictions. It is important to choose an appropriate value for K. A smaller K value makes the algorithm more sensitive to noise, while a larger K value can cause the algorithm to lose important patterns in the data.

Prediction Phase: Given a new input sample, the algorithm determines the K nearest neighbors in the training dataset based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). The distance can be calculated using various methods depending on the nature of the features.

Majority Voting (Classification) / Averaging (Regression): For classification, the class label of the new sample is determined by majority voting among its K nearest neighbors. Each neighbor contributes to the decision by casting a vote, and the class with the highest number of votes is chosen as the predicted class. In regression, the predicted value is computed by averaging the target values of the K nearest neighbors.

Output: The algorithm returns the predicted class label (classification) or the predicted target value (regression) for the new input sample.

It's worth noting that the KNN algorithm does not involve an explicit training phase where model parameters are learned. Instead, it directly uses the training data for prediction.

While KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets since it requires calculating distances for each new sample. Additionally, choosing an appropriate value for K and selecting the right distance metric are crucial for obtaining good results.
